# Fast-Furious-Paper
Reading Group @ DMG

# About

## House Rules
- Everyone needs to present & attend;
- Four papers a week (four presenters);
- TIme & Location: Wed @ SC 2124 (or 2102 if occupied).

## How to add a paper?
- Modify this readme file, but instead of committing directly to the `master` branch, please create a new branch and start a pull request (like a proposal).
- Everyone can only submit pull requests or merge pull requests *from others* (every proposal needs a second).
- The order of presentations would be decided in the alphabet order (of presenters).

**IMPORTANT:** you need to **approve** before merging the pull request.
